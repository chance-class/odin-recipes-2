My second recipe project

After completing the first Recipes project, I want to complete another one, with a new theme, to practice my commits and proper use of code. I'm using a theme I want to style with CSS later on. But I will utilize the same skills: HTML boilerplate, ordered and unordered lists, images and links, and div and id.
