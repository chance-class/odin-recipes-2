        <p>Jambalaya is a one-pot dish that's made with rice, meat or 
            seafood, and vegetables. With French and Spanish influences, 
            jambalaya is quite similar to paella. The name "jambalaya" 
            likely comes from the Provençal word "jambalaia," which means 
            mishmash.</p>
