        <p>A king cake is a type of cake that's associated with Mardi Gras, 
            New Orleans, and parts of the Gulf Coast. It's a ring-shaped pastry 
            that's usually covered in icing, then topped with yellow and purple 
            edible glitter or sprinkles. The cake traditionally contains a 
            porcelain or plastic baby that is supposed to bring good luck to 
            whoever winds up with it in their slice!</p>

            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Make pastry: Scald milk over medium heat. Remove from heat and stir in butter. Allow mixture to cool to room temperature.</li>
                <li>Stir together warm water, 1 tablespoon white sugar, and yeast in a large bowl. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add cooled milk mixture to yeast mixture and whisk in eggs. Stir in remaining white sugar, salt, and nutmeg. Beat flour, 1 cup at a time, into milk/egg mixture. Once dough comes together, turn it onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl; turn to coat. Cover with a damp cloth or plastic wrap; let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 2 hours. When risen, punch down and divide dough in half.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 375<sup>o</sup>F (190<sup>o</sup>C). Grease 2 cookie sheets or line with parchment paper.</li>
                <li>Make filling: Combine brown sugar, pecans, flour, raisins, and cinnamon in a bowl. Pour melted butter on top and mix until crumbly.</li>
                <li>Roll each piece of dough into a 10x16-inch rectangle. Sprinkle filling evenly over dough and roll up tightly like a jelly roll, beginning at a wide side. Bring the ends of each roll together to form 2 oval-shaped rings.</li>
                <li>Place each ring on a prepared cookie sheet. With scissors, make cuts 1/3 of the way through the rings at 1-inch intervals. Let rise in a warm spot until doubled in size, about 45 minutes.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until an inserted toothpick comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Check often for doneness so the ring doesn't overbake.</li>
                <li>Make glaze: Stir together confectioners' sugar and water in a bowl until smooth.</li>
                <li>Push doll into bottom of one warm cake. Drizzle glaze over both warm cakes.</li>
