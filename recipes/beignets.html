            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Dissolve yeast in warm water. Pour into a large bowl and stir in evaporated milk, white sugar, eggs, and salt. Add 4 cups flour and beat until smooth.</li>
                <li>Mix in shortening. Mix in remaining 3 cups flour. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or up to 24 hours.</li>
                <li>Roll dough out on floured surface to 1/8-inch thick. Cut into 2 1/2-inch squares.</li>
                <li>Heat oil in a deep pot to 360<sup>o</sup>F (180<sup>o</sup>C).</li>
                <li>Fry beignets in batches until browned and puffed. (If beignets sink and do not pop up, oil is not hot enough.) Remove from oil with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.</li>
                <li>Shake confectioners' sugar over hot beignets. Serve immediately.</li>
